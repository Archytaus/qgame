# Introduction

This project aims to allow rapid prototyping of game ideas across multiple platforms.

By using [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/) this project will allow the developer to maximise code re-use across projects.
Performance sensitive components can still be written in any of asm, c, c++, or objc and integrated to be called through the ruby interface.
